SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

The company workforce is male-dominated, with males slightly outnumbering females.

Non-conforming employees represent a very small proportion of the workforce, indicating limited gender diversity beyond binary categories.

The workforce is concentrated between ages 25–54, with the 35–44 age group being the largest.

Very few employees fall in the 18–24 and 55–64 ranges, suggesting:

Limited early-career hiring

Potential future retirement risk as the core workforce ages

Engineering, Accounting, and Human Resources have the highest employee counts, with Engineering showing the strongest male dominance.

Gender representation varies by department but follows the overall company trend.

The majority of employees work at headquarters, while a smaller but significant portion work remotely.

The workforce is racially diverse, though White employees form the largest group.

Other racial groups are fairly evenly distributed, indicating moderate diversity but room for improvement.

The average length of employment for terminated employees is ~8 years, suggesting:

Turnover often occurs after long tenure rather than early exits.

Employee numbers generally increased steadily from 2000 to 2020.

Net employee change remained positive most years, indicating overall company growth, with slight fluctuations in later years.

LIMITATIONS 

Data quality assumptions

The analysis assumes 0000-00-00 accurately represents active employees, which may not be realistic in real-world HR systems.

No performance or salary data

Turnover causes cannot be fully explained without compensation, engagement, or performance metrics.

Limited diversity categories

Gender and race categories may be simplified or incomplete, which can underrepresent real diversity.

Age filtering bias

Employees under 18 and over 65 are excluded, potentially missing interns or post-retirement contractors.

Tenure calculation for active employees

Average tenure is calculated only for terminated employees, not current staff, which limits workforce stability insights.

External factors not considered

Economic conditions, company policy changes, and industry trends were not included in the analysis.
